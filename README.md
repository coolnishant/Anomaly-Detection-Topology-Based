# Anomaly-Detection-Topology-Based

Using Random Forest Algorithm Classifier in we building classifiers.

This project is about anomaly detection in social network, completely on network structure. We use random forest algorithm to train and test our classifier. Also, we are going to see how the effect of increase of trees in forest to the accuracy of prediction.

Prequiste: Must have all python installed with these needed libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn and networkx.

How to Run:
1. Open Git Bash and enter this command
   $ git clone https://github.com/coolnishant/Anomaly-Detection-Topology-Based.git
2. Open folder runfromhere run python file "simple_feature_extraction_and_classifier.py"

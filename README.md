# Anomaly-Detection-Topology-Based

Using Random Forest Algorithm Classifier in we building classifiers.

This project is about anomaly detection in social network, completely on network structure. We use random forest algorithm to train and test our classifier. Also, we are going to see how the effect of increase of trees in forest to the accuracy of prediction.
